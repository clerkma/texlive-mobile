shortdesc Fix miscellaneous two column mode features
longdesc OBSOLETE: do not use in new documents. This package will do
longdesc nothing in LaTeX formats after 2015/01/01 as the fixes that it
longdesc implements were incorporated into the fixltx2e package, which
longdesc is itself obsolete as since the 2015/01/01 release these fixes
longdesc are in the LaTeX format itself. Fix mark handling so that
longdesc \firstmark is taken from the first column if that column has
longdesc any marks at all; keep two column floats like figure* in
longdesc sequence with single column floats like figure.
